# SUMMARY OF SERVICE
#
# Alarm has three modes: 
# 1. Armed Home - Set via terminal, used when we are at home, only boundary is monitored (doors and windows) 
# 2. Armed Away - Can be set on terminal or automatically when we leave, only boundary is monitored as dog maybe at home 
# 3. Armed Vacation - Set via terminal, used when all three of us are away, boundary and motion detection monitored. 
# Before the alarm arms a check is made to ensure all doors and windows are closed. For those away modes (2 and 3) there is a delay
# of 30 sec before arming completes. Time to vacate the building. For home (1) the alarm arms in 10 sec, enough time to cancel if 
# required.
